Fundamentals of Software Engineering Principles with Examples

# SOLID Principles

 1. Single Responsibility Principle

 - A class should have only **one reason** to change.
 - *Separation of Concerns* - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems.
 
 2. Open-Closed Principle

- Classes should be open for **extensions**, closed for *modifications*.

 3. Liskov Substitution Principle
 
 - Base type (base class) should be able to **substitute** for a subtype.
 
 4. Interface Segregation Principle
 
 - Do not put too much into an interface, split into **separate** interfaces.
 
 5. Dependency Inversion Principle

- High-level modules should not depends on low-level modules. Both should depends on **abstractions**.
