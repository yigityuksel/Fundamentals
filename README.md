Fundamentals of Software Engineering Principles with Examples

# SOLID Principles

 1. Single Responsibility Principle

> A class should have only one reason to change.
> Do one thing and do it well.
 
 2. Open-Closed Principle

> Open for extensions, closed for modifications.
 
 3. Liskov Substitution Principle
 
> Derived classes are extending base classes should behave normal without changing their behavior.
 
 4. Interface Segregation Principle
 
> The clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use.

 5. Dependency Inversion Principle

> High-level modules should not depends on low-level modules. Both should depends on abstractions.
